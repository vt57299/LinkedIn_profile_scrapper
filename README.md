# LinkedIn Profile Scraper

## Overview
This Python script automates the process of scraping LinkedIn profiles based on a search query. It utilizes Selenium and BeautifulSoup to log in to LinkedIn, perform a search, and scrape profile information including name, headline, location, profile URL, and connections. The scraped data is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- selenium
- beautifulsoup4

You can install them using the following:
```
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
```
Additionally, you need to download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser. This script is configured to use the Chrome WebDriver by default.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies and download the WebDriver.
2. Update the script with your LinkedIn username and password.
3. Run the script and enter your search query when prompted.
4. The script will scrape the profiles and save the data to a CSV file named profile_data.csv.

## Output
The script generates a CSV file named `profile_data.csv` containing the following information for each scraped profile:

- Name
- Headline
- Location
- Profile URL
- Connections

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and update the script with the WebDriver's path (if necessary).
4. Run the script to perform the LinkedIn Profile Scrapping
